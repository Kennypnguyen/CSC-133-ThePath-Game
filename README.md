# ThePath Game

Sacramento State CSC 133 in-class object-oriented graphics programming and design project. 
An individual project where I developed a cross platform game that allows the user to control an ant moving around a path avoiding collision of spiders keeping 
the ant fed. This project was based on object-oriented graphics programming and design where I implemented various design patterns such as observer/observable, 
iterator, command, and singleton. Also implemented object-oriented programming concepts such as abstraction, polymorphism, inheritance, and encapsulation
